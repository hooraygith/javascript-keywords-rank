Roadmap

Current Status

The WebAssembly Community Group has an initial (MVP) binary format release candidate and JavaScript API which are implemented in several browsers. The CG is now soliciting feedback from the broader community as part of a Browser Preview period. The tentative goal of the CG is for the Browser Preview to conclude in Q1 2017, though significant findings during the Browser Preview could potentially extend the duration. When the Browser Preview concludes, the CG will produce a draft specification of WebAssembly and browser vendors can start to ship conforming implementations on-by-default.

Developers should be aware that between the Browser Preview and public launch of WebAssembly, there will be at least one breaking change which will require developers to update their toolchain and binaries. These changes will be announced ahead of time and are listed below.

See Getting Started to start experimenting and Feedback for how and where to direct feedback.

Next Steps

In addition to processing feedback during the Browser Preview, the WebAssembly community group and contributors plan to:

distill the design and spec interpreter repos into a single unified specification in the spec repo
propose a new charter for a W3C WebAssembly Working Group
graduate the WebAssembly LLVM backend from experimental to stable (and update Emscripten)
prototype additional WebAssembly integration into browser developer tools
finalize a WebAssembly logo
Start work on post-MVP features
Create a publicly-runnable conformance test suite
Planned Changes Before Release

At the end of the Browser Preview period, the binary version will be reset to 0x1 (at which point the version will be frozen and all new features will be added in a backwards-compatible manner, and be detected through feature-testing).
As we receive significant user feedback, other items may be added here, or to the future features list.
